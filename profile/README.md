## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## [docker-compose](https://github.com/Horcrux14/docker-compose)
<p> This repo has the `docker-compose.yml` file which can be run using the `docker compose up` command.
This does the following


1. Starts Postgres DB
2. Runs SQL(Liquibase) migrations ([db](https://github.com/Horcrux14/db))
3. Starts spring-boot todo app ([app](https://github.com/Horcrux14/app))
4. Runs load tests on the todo spring-boot app ([jmeter](https://github.com/Horcrux14/jmeter))


> After app is available at default port 8080

> Any configuration can be cnaged in docker-compose.yml to configure it to run as wished to

> The default configurations are designed in a way to work out of box</p>

Cheers!
